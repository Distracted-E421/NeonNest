# Redis for Neon Nest

## Introduction and Vision

Brief description of Redis's role in the project. Explain how Redis enhances performance, manages sessions, or supports real-time operations.

## Technical Details

- **Version**: Specify the Redis version used.
- **Configuration**:
  - Detail any specific configurations made to Redis (e.g., persistence settings, memory management).
  - Include instructions for setting up Redis in a development environment.

## Data Model/Schema

- Describe the types of data stored in Redis (e.g., cache data, session information).
- Provide examples of key naming conventions or data structures used (hashes, lists, sets).

## Integration Points

- Explain how Redis interacts with other components of the system.
