# PostgreSQL for Neon Nest

## Introduction and Vision

Brief description of PostgreSQL role in the project. Explain how PostgreSQL enhances performance, manages sessions, or supports real-time operations.

## Technical Details

- **Version**: 16
- **Configuration**:
  - Detail any specific configurations made to PostgreSQL (e.g., persistence settings, memory management).
  - Include instructions for setting up PostgreSQL in a development environment.

## Data Model/Schema

- Describe the types of data stored in PostgreSQL (e.g., cache data, session information).
- Provide examples of key naming conventions or data structures used (hashes, lists, sets).

## Integration Points

- Explain how PostgreSQL interacts with other components of the system.
- Include information about client libraries used for connecting to PostgreSQL.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Initial setup and configuration.
- [ ] Define caching strategies.

- [ ] ...

## Future Structure and Expansion Plans

Discuss any anticipated scaling needs or performance optimizations for PostgreSQL in the context of the project's growth.

## Security and Backup Procedures

- Detail the security measures in place (e.g., access controls, encryption).
- Outline any backup and recovery strategies for the PostgreSQL data.

## Maintenance and Monitoring

- Instructions for routine maintenance tasks.
- Monitoring tools or metrics to keep an eye on (e.g., memory usage, query performance).
